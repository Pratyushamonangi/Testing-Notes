Manual Testing (functional, Non-functional), Safe Agile methodology, Live project, Project Selection.

Manual Testing: 
A Technique to test the software using functions and features of the application

(We will test the application by navigating to phase by phase and check the application)

In this testing a tester tests the software by following pre defined test cases

Testing > Functional, Non-functional

Functional Test planning:

Software Application > Developed group of computer programs when we give data they produce output. Developer writes some programs and user interface(UI) is visible to us. 
Ex: Flipkart and amazon

Two types in software application 
Project > Should be worked for limited number of audience
ex: Capegemini org. portal
Product > Should be worked for multiple set of audience
ex: amazon

App. is made based on req. 
ex: Budget planning, Choose a land, purchase land, Approvals, Civil engineer contract, Interior designer contract, House warming.

Software Development Life Cycle(SDLC):
1.Req. Gathering : Business analyst goes to customer or client and gather the needs & req. (BA-Technical analyst, Functional Analyst)
2.Planning 	 : Manager decides about planning
3.Design  	 : High level(app. architecture is complex ex: amazon), Low level(app. is designed phase by phase) - Test matrix(test plan, test scenario, test case, test steps)
4.Development 	 : Developer develops the code 
5.Testing	 : Check if the req. is satisfied as per client we test it and report if any error
6.Delivery & Maintenance : Once app. is delivered to customer & maintenance is provided further

Error : incorrect human action
Defect/Bug/issue/incident : if expected and actual result varies 
Failure : if the application
